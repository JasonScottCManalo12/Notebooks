### Why Business Basics Are Essential for Companies' Survival
Back to the original point: business often go bankrupt because they forget about the basics:
- The business must have enough cast to cover emergies (liquidity);
- The business must have enough assests so that if loans must be paid off, or taxes must be paid, the business can cover these "calls" on its assets (solvency); and
- The business must continue to be profitable, which means that it continues to bring in more income than revenue, thus building up cash and other assets (viability).
	"Basic Business principles. Forget them at your peril."


### Why Companies go Bankrupt?
Neglecting the basic principles of liquidity, solvency, and viability.
1. Liquidity
	- is the most short-term of these measures because it refers to the ability of a busines to quickly turn assets into cash without loss.
3. Solvency 
	- is measured with a business ratio called the "current ratio" which compares current assets (receivables, supplies, and inventory) to current liabilities (those debts you owe that are due within the next year, like your taxes, payroll taxes, and monthly payments on your business loan). 
	- The "current ratio" is supposed to be 2:1.
	- That is, the value of your current assets should be twice the amount of your current liabilities.
	- The principle of solvency is related to liquidity, but it is a little broader.
	- If a business is solvent it has enough assets to cover it liabilities. 
	- If all of the creditors of the business called in the loans and demanded payment (kind of like a run on the bank for business), the business would have to sell or dispose of current assets, at a loss.
3. Viability
	- the concept of viability is often discussed with living being (new born, for example) and their ability not only to survive but thrive.
	- Economic viability means contuining sustainable profits for a business over a period of time. It doesn't mean that every quarter is profitable, which provides for liquidity for emergencies and solvency for current needs.

`Remember that a business can be profitable without a lot of cash. Profits are just on paper; cash is in the bank.`
