### Why Business Basics Are Essential for Companies' Survival
Back to the original point: business often go bankrupt because they forget about the basics:
- The business must have enough cast to cover emergies (liquidity);
- The business must have enough assests so that if loans must be paid off, or taxes must be paid, the business can cover these "calls" on its assets (solvency); and
