### Why Business Basics Are Essential for Companies' Survival
Back to the original point: business often go bankrupt because they forget about the basics:
- The business must have enough cast to cover emergies (liquidity);
- The business must have enough assests so that if loans must be paid off, or taxes must be paid, the business can cover these "calls" on its assets (solvency); and
- The business must continue to be profitable, which means that it continues to bring in more income than revenue, thus building up cash and other assets (viability).
	"Basic Business principles. Forget them at your peril."


### Why Companies go Bankrupt?
Neglecting the basic principles of liquidity, solvency, and viability.
1. Liquidity
	- is the most short-term of these measures because it refers to the ability of a busines to quickly turn assets into cash without loss.
3. Solvency 
	- is measured with a business ratio called the "current ratio" which compares current assets (receivables, supplies, and inventory) to current liabilities (those debts you owe that are due within the next year, like your taxes, payroll taxes, and monthly payments on your business loan). 
	- The "current ratio" is supposed to be 2:1.
	- That is, the value of your current assets should be twice the amount of your current liabilities.
	- The principle of solvency is related to liquidity, but it is a little broader.
	- If a business is solvent it has enough assets to cover it liabilities. 
	- If all of the creditors of the business called in the loans and demanded payment (kind of like a run on the bank for business), the business would have to sell or dispose of current assets, at a loss.
3. Viability
	- the concept of viability is often discussed with living being (new born, for example) and their ability not only to survive but thrive.
	- Economic viability means contuining sustainable profits for a business over a period of time. It doesn't mean that every quarter is profitable, which provides for liquidity for emergencies and solvency for current needs.

`Remember that a business can be profitable without a lot of cash. Profits are just on paper; cash is in the bank.`

### OPTION 1
### Growing rice from seed
### Steps&#58;
1. Soak the seeds in water for about 36 hours and allow to dry for another 24 hours
2. Fill a bucket with 6 inches of a mixture of soil and compost.
3. Add about 5 inches of water to cover the soil.
4. Even spread the seeds in the bucket and place in warm, sunny area
5. Periodically add more water to maintain a constant 5-inch depth as plants grow

### OPTION 2
### Growing Rice from seed
### Steps&#58;
1. Find Containers without holes
2. Purchase rice seed from a gardening supplier or buy long grain brown rice from bulk foods store or in a bag.
3. Fill the bucket or plastic container with 6 inches of dirt or plotting soil.
4. Add water up to 2 inches over the soil level. The rice will sink to the dirt.
5. Keep the bucket in a warm, sunny area and move it a warm place at night. Rice plants don't need too much care from here on out.
6. Keep the water level at 2 inches or so above the dirt. When the rice plants are 5-6 inches tall,
7. increase the water depth to 4 inches.
8. Then allow the water level to lower on its own ovre a period of time. Ideally, by the time you harvest them, the plants should no longer be in standing water.
	> If all goes well, rice is ready to harvest in its fourth month. The stalks will go from green to gold to indicate it is time to harvest. Harvesting rice means cutting and gathering the panicles attached to the stalks. 
9. To harvest the rice, cut the stalks and allow them to dry, wrapped in a newspaper, for two to three weeks in a warm, dry place.
10. Once the rice stalks have dried, roast in a very low heat oven (under 200F/93C) for around an hour, then the hulls by hand. That's it; you can now cook with your very own home grown, long grain brown rice.


### Grow a Potato

Note&#58; The soil is slightly moisture. The soil must be at least 4 inches in depth. Tubers must stay inside the soil. Cover potato cuts with dust sulfur before planting. Cure the digged uo potatoes for 2 weeks.

Growing period is about 90 to 120 days Cover them with 3 to 4 inches. 12 inches apart. Cut the potato in small pieces. Leave 3 to 4 days to heal then plant.


### Grow a Chili

1. Use bird's eye chili pepper seeds purchased at a garden store or supermarket or you can dry your own.
2. Place one (1) seed per hole in a seedling tray with potting mix, water.
3. After 18 to 21 days, transfer to your garden plot or container. Add 100g of organica fertilizer or vermicompost.
4. Water every three (3) days, only.
5. After 20 days, fertilize with urea and completer fertilizer to encourage growth of more branches.
6. Forty (40) after transplanting, add complete fertilizer with potassium; this is to ensure the fruit will be bigger and more plentiful.
7. After 75 days (from initial planting), your plant will bear its ripened sili fruit.

	- Use animal maure and compost (or vermicast) to fertilize or grow hot pepper around basket compost.
3. Watering

4. Pest and Disease Management
